        Online reviews have become an important source of information for users before 
        making an informed purchase decision. Early reviews of a product tend to have a high impact
        on the subsequent product sales. In this paper, we take the initiative to study the behavior 
        characteristics of early reviewers through their posted reviews on two real-world large e-commerce platforms, i.e., Amazon and Yelp.. A user who has posted a review before 
        purchasing the product is considered as an early reviewer. We quantitatively characterize early 
        reviewers based on their rating behaviors, the helpfulness scores received from others and the 
        correlation of their reviews with product popularity. We have found that an early reviewer 
        tends to assign a higher average rating score; and an early reviewer tends to post not helpful 
        reviews. Our analysis of product reviews also indicates that early reviewers ratings and their 
        received helpfulness scores are likely to influence product popularity. By viewing review 
        posting process as a multiplayer competition game, we propose a novel margin-based 
        embedding model for early reviewer prediction. Extensive experiments on two different e-commerce datasets have shown that our proposed approach outperforms a number of baselines.</font>
